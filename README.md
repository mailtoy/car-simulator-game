### Motivation
The prospect of autonomous cars may still seem impossibly futuristic. In history, the full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when enhanced by warning or intervention systems. This project has proposed the full performance of driving by an automated driving system under all roadway and environmental conditions that can also be managed by human drivers.
